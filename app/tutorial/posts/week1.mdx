# What is it?

> The Spacecraft Control Toolbox (SCT) for MATLAB lets users design, analyze, and simulate spacecraft of any complexity.

# Prerequisites

You will need to have some familiarity with MATLAB. If it’s been a while since you’ve used the language or need a bit of a refresher you can follow this introductory course to learn the basics of MATLAB: [https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted)

Before you continue ensure that your MATLAB environment is correctly setup and you are familiar with how to run basic MATLAB programs.

# Getting started

The following section will take you through the installation process to getting your first simulation up and running!

## Installation

### 1. Download necessary files

All necessary files for the Satellite Control Toolbox can be found on our course Moodle page.

### 2. Install SCT either manually or from a toolbox file

We have provided two options for you to install SCT.

### Option 1: Manual installation

1. Create a new folder for your SCT installation.
2. Simply extract all folders you have downloaded from Moodle into the new folder you have created. Your folder structure should look something like this:

<aside className='flex justify-center'>
  ![SCT file structure](/images/1.1.png)
</aside>

3. Now we need to set the MATLAB path to include the new toolbox software. A function `PSSSetPaths.m` has been provided to do this.

   1. From the MATLAB command prompt navigate to your toolbox folder:

      ```matlab
      >> cd [YOUR_PATH_TO_SCT]
      ```

   2. Now run `PSSSetPaths` and click “Yes” when prompted to save path:

      ```matlab
      >> PSSSetPaths

      Your path has been updated and saved.
      ```

   3. Verify that your path has been correctly set by typing `ver` which should give you some output like this:

<aside className='flex justify-center ml-12'>
  ![SCT file structure](/images/1.2.png)
</aside>

### Option 2: Install from the single `.mltbx1` file

1. The `SCTAcademic.mltbx` file contains all of the source code for the toolbox.
2. Double click on this file to install.
3. This method will install all source code as an add-on within the default MATLAB directory e.g. on Windows: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\MathWorks\MATLAB\Add-Ons\Toolboxes\SCTAcademic`
4. Verify your installation by running `ver`, which should give you the same output as above.

Note that this method installs version 2022 files while Option 1 installs 2023 (2022 is fine for AERO9610). The benefit of this method is that it comes with HTML documentation - see below.

### **Documentation**

If you used Option 2 to install SCT, there is HTML documentation that is available by clicking on the “Supplemental Software” tab in the help browser.

The theory guide, namely the “Spacecraft Attitude and Orbit Control” also provides more technical background. You can access it via the [UNSW Library](https://primoa.library.unsw.edu.au/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9951459154801731&context=L&vid=61UNSW_INST:UNSWS&lang=en&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,Spacecraft%20Attitude%20and%20Orbit%20Control)

## Exploring Demos

SCT provides a number of demos in the form of a DemoPSS GUI to help you get started with the toolbox. Each toolbox or module has a `Demos` folder and a function `DemoPSS.m`

<aside className='bg-pink-100 rounded-md p-1 pl-4'>
  ⚠️ Never move or remove this function from any of your modules!
</aside>

(`DemoPSS.m` looks for other `DemoPSS` functions to determine the location of all demos so it can display them in the demo GUI)

### Running the DemoPSS GUI

To open the DemoPSS GUI run the following command in the command line:

```matlab
>> DemoPSS
```

You should see the following interface:

<aside className='flex justify-center'>
  ![SCT file structure](/images/1.3.png)
</aside>

All demos are visible in the hierarchical menu to the left. For each demo, you can open the script or run the demo.

Let’s start off by running the `SCTTutorial` demo. Select the `SCTTutorial` script underneath `SC/Demos/Attitude` and click on “Run the Demo”. You should see the following output:

<aside className='flex justify-center'>
  ![SCT file structure](/images/1.4.png)
</aside>

Now, press any key to step through the demo. A each stage a number of plots should be generated. Here's an example of one plotting the response of an attitude control system:

</aside>

## Some useful functions: `FileHelp` and `Finder`

SCT provides over two thousand functions for attitude and orbit dynamics, simulation, estimation, analysis, and design.

Navigating your way through and finding out what certain functions do can be tricky, hence two functions `FileHelp` and `Finder` are there to make your life easier!

You can run them typing the following commands in the command line:

```matlab
>> FileHelp
```

<div className='h-8'></div>

```matlab
>> Finder
```

# Todo

1. Familiarise yourself with SCT and the functionality it provides. Play around with some more demos to get a feel for the software.
2. For the assignment you will need to use SCT to guide your design process. Now is the time to start looking at a space mission you would like to design - do some research, find what interests you and what innovations you can potentially bring to the table!
