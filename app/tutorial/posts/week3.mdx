# Preamble

In this tutorial we will be simulating a dynamical model of a CubeSat in orbit and looking at how disturbances affect its attitude profile.

## Theory

See Lecture Slides from Week 3.1 and Chapter 8 from Spacecraft Attitude and Orbit Control textbook.

# Tutorial

## Generate CubeSat structures

Inside of `/CubeSat/Modelling` there is a function `CubeSatModel.m` that generates vertices and faces for a CubeSat model.

Without giving input parameters, this function by default will generate a 6U CubeSat and a 3U CubeSat with deployed solar panels.

```matlab
% Make sure you are in the right directory
>> pwd
'.../SCTAcademic/CubeSat/Modelling'

% Run the function
>> CubeSatModel
```

You should see the following output:

<aside className='flex justify-center'>![CubeSatModel](/images/3.1.png)</aside>

## Simulation

Now, we will simulate a satellite with tilted wings. Run `CubeSatTiltedWings.m` in the directory of `/SCTAcademic/CubeSat/Demos/Design`

```matlab
% Make sure you are in the right directory
>> pwd
'~/SCTAcademic/CubeSat/Demos/Design'

% Run the function
>> CubeSatTiltedWings
```

You should generate some plots that look like this:

<aside className='flex justify-center ml-4'>
  ![CubeSatTiltedWings](/images/3.2.png)
</aside>

# Things to try

1. Modify `CubeSatModel` so that the solar panels are perpendicular to the CubeSat body. How does this affect the disturbances?
2. Change the number of solar panel wings on the CubeSat.
3. **Extension:** Change the orientation of the solar wings along the long edge of the CubeSat.

# Additional CAD examples

While the examples in this tutorial have relatively simple structures, if you are interested in creating more complex satellites using the in-built CAD tools you can play around with the examples found in `/SCTAcademic/SC/Demos/CAD` .

If you can generate CAD models for your CubeSat assignment, additional bonus points can be awarded to you. See the Final Report Marking Rubric for more details. ðŸ˜‡

# Conduct a structural simulation for your chosen mission

1. Adapt the parameters for your own CubeSat.
2. Generate the shape with deployed solar panels if necessary.
3. Save all figures and present them into your reports with all necessary analysis.

## Hints and tips

Take a look at `d.solarPanel.sPanel` and `d.solarPanel.cellNormal` in `CubeSatTiltedWings` and
compare and contrast this to the same parameters in the default case in `CubeSatModel`.
Parameters such as `rPanel`, `sPanel` and `cellNormal` are written as a 3 x W array, where W is
the number of solar wings you want to include on the satellite.
