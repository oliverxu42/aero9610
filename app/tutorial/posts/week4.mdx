# Preamble

---

Spacecraft are subject to unique thermal challenges e.g. large temperature gradients, sources of heat from nearly all other subsystems; power, structure, payload, ADCS etc. Modelling and simulating the thermal subsystem gives us a way to select thermal control strategies and ensure that our spacecraft maintains safe operating temperatures.

1. You can make use of the CAD model you produced from last weekâ€™s structural simulations.
2. You will need make some initial estimations e.g. mass, total surface area, average specific heat - this is okay! Make sure you justify them and refine these estimations as your design iterates.
3. Iterate!
