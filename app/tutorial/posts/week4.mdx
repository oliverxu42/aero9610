# Preamble

Spacecraft are subject to unique thermal challenges e.g. large temperature gradients, sources of heat from nearly all other subsystems; power, structure, payload, ADCS etc. Modelling and simulating the thermal subsystem gives us a way to select thermal control strategies and ensure that our spacecraft maintains safe operating temperatures.

## Theory

This tutorial will revolve around simulating an isothermal model, a useful model when trying to analyse the thermal state of an entire spacecraft.

Where:

- $T$ : spacecraft temperature
- $\varepsilon_r$ : radiator emissivity
- $A_r$ : radiator area
- $\alpha$ : surface absorptivity
- $A_{proj}$ : total surface area of the spacecraft seen by the sun (cross-section or projected area)
- $S$ : incoming solar flux
- $Q_{gen}$ : heat generated by the internal power
- $m$ : spacecraft's mass
- $c_p$ : average specific heat of the spacecraft

- The function `RHSIsothermalCubeSat` $(t_0,..., d, p)$ is an isothermal CubeSat model dynamical right-hand-side.
- The entire spacecraft is assumed to be at the same temperature.
- $p$ is the net input vector which includes sun, albedo, and earth radiation. You should also factor in eclipses.
- The total power is the internal power that is absorbed by the spacecraft. The specific heat is the
  average over the whole spacecraft.

Let’s have a look at results from this simulation:

[PLOT RESULTS]

# Questions

1. Why does the temperature present peak and low values?
2. What does the “1367” correspond to on line 69 of the code?
3. On line 35, what do the following functions `d.uSurface`, `d.alpha` and `d.epsilon` do?
4. How has the light-of-sight/eclipse effect been factored in?

# Things to try

1. Design a 3U CubeSat structure by using `CubeSatModel` and `DrawCubeSat` functions. (Take a look at last week’s workshop if you need a refresher)
2. Replace the radiator on the +Z face of the CubeSat with gold foil, what is the average difference in temperature, what about the -Z radiator? Keep in mind what coordinate system this is in.
3. Play around with the orbital elements and look at their effect, e.g. try a non-zero inclination and a non-zero eccentricity and see the differences in their temperature.
4. **Extension:** integrate the isothermal model with the orbit, attitude, and power dynamical model within `RHSCubeSat`, which was used in Weeks 2-3. Generate orbit, attitude, power, **and temperature** time series for the CubeSat (5-10 bonus points will be awarded if you have done this and included relevant plots in your final report).

# Additional thermal examples

There are much more detailed thermal examples in your textbook Spacecraft
Attitude and Orbit Control Volume 2, 4th Edition, namely - Thermal Example (23.9) and Solar Panel Examples (23.10).

These consider the spacecraft as a thermal network with multiple nodes, which is much more realistic than the isothermal model.

The Solar Panel Examples differentiate between front and back sides of a solar panel for equilibrium temperature.

# Conduct a thermal simulation for your chosen mission

1. You can make use of the CAD model you produced from last week’s structural simulations.
2. You will need make some initial estimations e.g. mass, total surface area, average specific heat - this is okay! Make sure you justify them and refine these estimations as your design iterates.
3. Simulate an isothermal model using the code from this workshop.
4. **Extension:** perform a detailed thermal analysis by considering your spacecraft as a thermal network.
