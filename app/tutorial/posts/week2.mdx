summary: 'Simulating a dynamical model of a CubeSat in orbit and looking at how disturbances affect its attitude profile'
---

By now you should have successfully set up your SCT environment and be able to run some basic simulations via the DemoPSS GUI. If you aren’t at this stage yet please review Week 1’s workshop [here](https://aero9610.vercel.app/tutorial/week1).

# Preamble

In this tutorial we will be simulating a dynamical model of a CubeSat in orbit and looking at how disturbances affect its attitude profile.

## Theory

The space environment subjects satellites to a number of torques and disturbances e.g. drag, solar radiation pressure etc. These disturbances must be effectively controlled to ensure proper and safe operation. Using SCT, we can simulate a dynamical model of a CubeSat and analyse its attitude profiles which we can use to guide our satellite’s design.

Have a read through of Chapter 14 from Spacecraft Attitude and Orbit Control textbook and Lecture Slides from Week 2.2.

### What is a dynamical model?

A mathematical representation of a system's behaviour over time, they capture how a system responds to different inputs or disturbances.

For our spacecraft our dynamical model will consist of the following state vector:

The SCT code uses a numerical methods (specifically [RK4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)) to propagate the state vector and simulate our spacecraft over time.

# Tutorial

Let’s begin by running the simulation:

```matlab
% Make sure you are in the right directory
>> pwd
.../SCTAcademic/CubeSat/Demos/Simulation

% Run the simulation
>> CubeSatSimulation
```

<aside className='bg-pink-100 rounded-md p-2 pl-4 mt-8'>
  ⚠️ Note: `PltOrbit.m` might not work with your MATLAB version if it also has
  an `earth.mat` file, which conflicts with the `earth.mat` file coming with
  SCT. The temporary solution is either to remove the path of the MATLAB
  `earth.mat` or change the name of SCT’s `earth.mat` (which is located at
  `SCTAcademic\SC\SCMat`) as well as updating the calling code in `PltOrbit.m`
</aside>

This simulation includes gravity, drag and radiation pressure. The satellite is initialised pointing to the Earth with a rotation equal to the orbit rate, to nominally maintain that pointing. The z body axis
is pointed towards the Earth (nadir).

Attitude is maintained with magnetic torquers which are modelled as a dipole (we’ll explore this in more detail in Week 7).

Here’s a brief breakdown of some the key functions:

# Questions

1. Why does the altitude of the satellite decrease?
2. What is the largest torque acting on the CubeSat?
3. Can you fix the problem when trying to plot radiation torques?

# Things to try

1. Plot the force due to spherical gravity.
2. Turn surface disturbances off by setting `d.surfData` to empty. What difference does the make?
3. Comment out or change the fixed dipole in the for-loop on line 157. What do you notice?
4. Modify the code to simulate a 1U instead of a 3U. How does the size impact on its dynamics?

# Additional examples

`SCDisturbanceAnalysis.m` in the directory of `/SCTAcademic/SC/Demos/SystemDesign` is another good one to have a look at, along with numerous other examples in `SCTAcademic/CubeSat/Demos/Simulation` which you can check out for simulating disturbances.

# Simulating orbit/attitude profiles for your chosen mission

For your assignment, you will be _required_ to produce SCT simulations of your work to prove that your design is viable.

The first step in the design of a satellite mission is usually determining the orbital profile of your spacecraft. From there you can work out what forces and/or torques need to be considered and how it will impact your attitude profiles. Thankfully, we can do all of this SCT!

1. Start out by determining your initial orbit and attitude values by considering your specific mission requirements.
2. Next, think about what forces/torques need to be considered for your specific mission e.g. drag is much more significant for satellites in LEO than higher up in GEO.
3. Work out your RHS of the ordinary differential equations.
4. Simulate this scenario in SCT, generate relevant plots and provide necessary analysis - present them in your reports!
